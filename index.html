	<h2> Books ðŸ“–</h2>
		<p>
			I am passionate of reading. Since I am younger I read everytime I can. I read about  two books a week, generally, I read in the subway because I don't have much time at home. Moreover, I have a huge library in my room with plenty of books, it is amazing ! I am crazy about reading "new romance's" books, it is my favourite type of books ! If you want to read and you don't know what book, don't hesitate to ask me !

	<h2> Music â™« </h2>
		<p>
			I am passionate of listening music. Actually, when I was young, I had a CD-player and I was listenin CDs with my mom, then at 10 I had my first Mp3. Now, I have my iPhone and my AirPods and I listen a lot of music. My favourite artits are Nekfeu and PNL, they are french rappers'. Music makes me be melancholic about the past because it makes me remember a lot of memories. One song is one memory, one moment. If you want to know who I listen, you can go on my <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/cmllcz"target="_blank"> Apple Music page</a> !
